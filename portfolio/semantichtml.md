**Meta Description:** Semantic HTML makes the web more accessible by providing meaning to elements. Learn what it is and how web pages can benefit from semantic implementation.

# What is Semantic HTML?

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the main programming language for structuring web page content. The syntax can take on two forms, either non-semantic or semantic. ‘Semantic’ means to give meaning to something. Check out this Forum for a general guide to getting started with learning semantic HTML with us. 

Both forms are used interchangeably in web pages today. HTML originated as a non-semantic (only) language. However, as the web evolved, writing HTML semantically has become the practical standard — largely due to its inherent benefits, including improved accessibility, SEO performance, and overall readability. This blog will review what semantic HTML is and discuss the benefits of why you need to implement it in your web pages. 

## What is semantic HTML, and why is it important?

We primarily use code snippets, called elements, when marking up with HTML. The HTML element typically consists of a start and end tag, although sometimes only one tag is used (such as for the `<img>` element). The .html file for this page contains paragraph elements. And paragraph tags surround the text of this very paragraph. It looks like this: `<p>`text`</p>`. Where `<p>` is the start tag and `</p>` is the end tag. 

Some HTML elements are used to group certain parts of HTML code together, like the commonly used `<div>` element. One problem is that `<div>` is non-semantic. So to specify certain `<div>` elements, web developers would have to add an id attribute to identify and style easily. Another problem is that the id attribute doesn’t necessarily fix the semantic problem for web pages. 

There needed to be more specific elements that group HTML content. Enter: semantic HTML. Examples of semantic elements are `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<article>`. 

* `<nav>` contains and styles the main navigation bar, including mostly internal webpage links. 
*	`<header>` is found at the top of the webpage and typically contains the search bar, site logo, name, etc. 
*	`<footer>` is found at the bottom of the webpage and usually contains contact info, career links, and the website’s privacy policy. 
*	`<article>` is an element that contains full content, such as this blog post or other write-ups. This tag is written within the `<body>` of HTML files. 

These, and all, semantic elements are important because they add meaning to HTML tags. What is the importance of adding meaning to elements? Well, that leads us to the next section on the benefits of semantic HTML. 

## What are the benefits of semantic HTML?

There are three main benefits to using semantic HTML as opposed to non-semantic HTML. All of which are related to improving the consistency of websites across the internet. When marking up in non-semantic HTML, the id attributes are subject to whatever the site’s developer wants to name them. When developers write semantically, they use names for elements that all websites agree with and that browsers can understand. So, it simply makes writing in HTML more interoperable across the internet. Let’s review the three main benefits.  

### Accessibility

There are two schools of thought in terms of semantic HTML improving accessibility. The first is that it is better for mobile applications. Why? Because semantic HTML is capable of being smaller in file size than non-semantic HTML. The reason for this is that all those id attributes can increase file size. The difference isn’t that significant but certainly can play a role for larger websites. Also, responsiveness is improved because the browser can interpret the code better. 

The second reason for semantic HTML improving accessibility is for screen readers. It is important to provide a seamless experience for all users, including those using screen readers. Semantic HTML clearly defines sections of the web page and is consistent across the web. Writing HTML with good semantics can help people burdened with visual, hearing, mobility, and other impairments. So, semantic HTML is the language for the World Wide Web. 

Semantic HTML is beneficial for providing more universal web pages. However, it is also a matter of ethics. Writing HTML source code with good semantics shows that you are inclusive. In some countries, semantic HTML is even required by law. 

### SEO

Improving Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows for an increased viewership of a webpage. How can semantic HTML improve SEO? The answer is that the content of websites becomes more identifiable to search engines. Again, browsers can interpret the code better because it understands how to identify semantic HTML elements. Thus there is consistency across web pages. 

If you are writing non-semantic HTML, SEO performance can be affected because the browser will not read the id attribute. Going further than site visitors, SEO is important for a number of other business-related reasons that we only brush the surface of in this blog post. 

### Readability

Writing code that is readable is important for developers when creating web pages. So, semantic HTML can improve web development efficiency. Whether you are creating the source code for the first time or are making quick updates, sticking to semantic HTML tags is beneficial. 

Semantic HTML can also make coding in CSS easier because you can style via the semantic element tags instead of by id attribute.

## Develop yourself on Codecademy

Starting to write semantically is difficult in HTML because it requires you to know more HTML jargon. However, it is relatively quick to pick up once you start implementing it in your web pages. Over time, it simplifies the writing process because the code is straight to the point instead of writing all-encompassing elements that aren’t clear. 

For more examples of semantic versus non-semantic elements, check out our new coding terms glossary, Codecademy Docs. As always, never stop learning. There will always be areas to improve. We aim to make it easy for you to find those areas of improvement. If you want to learn more about coding semantics and already have experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then you may be interested in our Handlebars course. The Handlebars engine allows developers to create dynamic web pages faster with semantic templates.
